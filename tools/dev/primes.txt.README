Fetched from: http://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/10000.txt

Edited to remove extraneous text, and to only retain primes in the [0,
65535] range, plus one more as a sentinel. We are looking for twin
primes no larger than 2^32, so (one of) their factors will be no
larger than 2^16.

(actually, it has been adjusted downwards to a hash storing no more
than 2^31 items)
