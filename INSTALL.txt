1. DEPENDENCIES

1.1. SCons build system

### I've always built with the scons-local package. I'm not sure how
### things look if scons is installed on the system. Here are the
### directions for using scons-local.

Fetch the scons-local package:
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scons/scons-local-2.0.1.tar.gz

Unpack this into the trunk directory (ie. scons.py should be a sibling
of the SConstruct file).

To build PoCore:

$ ./scons.py


1.2. C99 compliance

PoCore generally wants a C99-compliant environment, but uses
C89-compliant code (to support Microsoft compilers). Some specific
issues are noted below:

* stdint.h (C99 standard)

If your platform doesn't have it, see the "External links" section on
this page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdint.h

### maybe we can just include a copy, for use when we can't find a
### suitable copy?


1.3. libev

Fetch a (recent) version of libev from:
  http://dist.schmorp.de/libev/

### not sure what our minimum version should be right now
### where to place this?
