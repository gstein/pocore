To construct svn-st-alloc.log, I modified apr_pools.c to log
appropriate actions. Each action produced an entry with four fields:
action-name, pool-ptr, parent-ptr, size. There were four possible
actions, with the following field usage:

  alloc, pool, NULL, size
  create, resulting-pool, parent, 0
  clear, pool, NULL, 0
  destory, pool, NULL, 0

The log file was produced by running "svn status" from the /trunk
directory of a working copy of the Subversion source. This is a
good-sized working copy, and the Subversion application makes
extensive use of pools.

The intent is to use this log as a reference for (one) "typical"
application's use of memory, and then to guide our own design for a
memory allocator.

As a quick reference, here are the operation counts:

alloc: 412109
create: 22268
clear: 22410
destroy: 22268
